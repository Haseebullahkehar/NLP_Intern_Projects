# **NLP Internship at Codex Cue Software Solutions**

Welcome to the repository for my internship at **Codex Cue Software Solutions** as an **NLP Intern**! This document outlines the projects I worked on during the internship, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, tools, and frameworks.

---

## **Overview**

During my internship, I contributed to four impactful projects leveraging NLP to solve real-world problems:

1. **Sentiment Analysis of Social Media**  
2. **Spam Message Filter**  
3. **Keyword Extraction from Articles**  
4. **Movie Recommender System (Golden Project)**  

Each project aimed to explore and implement innovative solutions using state-of-the-art NLP methodologies.

## **Projects**

### 1️⃣ **Sentiment Analysis of Social Media**

**Description**:  
Developed a robust model to analyze the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of tweets and social media posts. The system helped assess public opinion and trends in real time.

**Key Highlights**:
- Preprocessed text data by handling noise, stop words, and tokenization.  
- Leveraged machine learning models like **Logistic Regression** and **SVM**, and fine-tuned **BERT** for improved accuracy.  
- Achieved an accuracy of **88%** on validation data.  
- Deployed a **Flask-based API** for live sentiment analysis.  

**Tools & Techniques**:  
`Python`, `NLTK`, `sklearn`, `Hugging Face Transformers`, `Flask`.

### 2️⃣ **Spam Message Filter**

**Description**:  
Implemented a text classification model to detect and filter spam messages from SMS/email datasets. This project focused on protecting users from phishing and fraudulent messages.

**Key Highlights**:
- Cleaned and vectorized data using **TF-IDF** and **Word2Vec** embeddings.  
- Built and compared multiple classifiers: **Naive Bayes**, **Random Forest**, and **LSTM** for spam detection.  
- Final model achieved **95% precision and recall**, minimizing false positives.  

**Tools & Techniques**:  
`Python`, `NLTK`, `TensorFlow`, `Pandas`.

### 3️⃣ **Keyword Extraction from Articles**

**Description**:  
Developed a pipeline to automatically extract key topics and keywords from large articles, aiding in summarization and indexing. 

**Key Highlights**:
- Utilized **RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction)** and **TF-IDF** techniques for extracting relevant keywords.  
- Implemented **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** with **SpaCy** to extract entities like names, organizations, and locations.  
- Created a user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing articles.  

**Tools & Techniques**:  
`Python`, `SpaCy`, `RAKE`, `Gensim`.

### 4️⃣ **Movie Recommender System (Golden Project)**

**Description**:  
Built a personalized movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and NLP-based content filtering techniques.

**Key Highlights**:
- Designed a hybrid recommendation system combining **user-based collaborative filtering** with **content-based filtering** using NLP to analyze movie plots and genres.  
- Employed **Cosine Similarity** for measuring content similarity and **Matrix Factorization (SVD)** for collaborative filtering.  
- Created an interactive web app for users to explore recommendations.  
- Finalized as the **Golden Project**, earning high praise for its functionality and performance.

**Tools & Techniques**:  
`Python`, `Pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `Surprise Library`, `Streamlit`.
